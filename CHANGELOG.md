### NOTE:

Starting from this version, we have added a new optional boolean parameter performFullFlush to the flush() method. Default to `false`, a partial flush will be executed for reducing memory footprint. The updated flush() is as follows:
```
    /*
    - parameter performFullFlush: A optional boolean value indicating whether a full flush should be performed. If `true`, a full flush will be triggered, sending all events to the server. Default to `false`, a partial flush will be executed for reducing memory footprint.
    - parameter completion: an optional completion handler for when the flush has completed.
    */
    public func flush(performFullFlush: Bool = false, completion: (() -> Void)? = nil) 
```

#

## [v3.4.0](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift/tree/v3.4.0) (2022-06-30)

### Enhancements

- add an option for 'createAlias' for not calling identify [\#547](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift/pull/547)

When you call the API `createAlias`, there is an implicit `identify` call inside the API done for you. This will keep your signup funnels working correctly in most cases. However, if that is not what you want, this PR will allow you to not call `identify` by specifying `andIdentify` to `false`.

 Please also note: With Mixpanel Identity Merge enabled, calling alias is no longer required but can be used to merge two IDs in scenarios where `identify` would fail.
