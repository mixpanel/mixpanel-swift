# Introduction

Welcome to the official Mixpanel Swift Library

The Mixpanel Swift library for iOS is an open source project, and we'd love to see your contributions! 
We'd also love for you to come and work with us! Check out **[Jobs](https://mixpanel.com/jobs/#openings)** for details.

If you are using Objective-C, we recommend using our **[Objective-C Library](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone)**.

<a name="current-supported-features"></a>
## Current supported features

**Our master branch and our releases are now on Swift 5.**

**If you wish to use our Swift 4.2 implementation, please point to the v2.6.1 release. For Swift 4/4.1 implementation, please point to the v2.4.5 release. For Swift 3 implementation, please point to the v2.2.3 release. For Swift 2.3 implementation, please point to the v1.0.1 release.**

Our Swift library fully supports all of the Mixpanel features, and has full parity with the [Objective-C Library](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone).

# Installation

<a name="cocoapods"></a>
## CocoaPods

**Our current release only supports CocoaPods version 1.4.0+**

Mixpanel supports `CocoaPods` for easy installation.
To Install, see our **[swift integration guide »](https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/swift)**

For iOS, tvOS, macOS, and App Extension integrations:

`pod 'Mixpanel-swift'`

<a name="carthage"></a>
## Carthage

Mixpanel also supports `Carthage` to package your dependencies as a framework. Include the following dependency in your Cartfile:

`github "mixpanel/mixpanel-swift"`

Check out the **[Carthage docs »](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)** for more info. 

<a name="manual-installation"></a>
### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but mixpanel-swift does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding mixpanel-swift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

## Manual Installation

To help users stay up to date with the latests version of our Swift SDK, we always recommend integrating our SDK via CocoaPods, which simplifies version updates and dependency management. However, there are cases where users can't use CocoaPods. Not to worry, just follow these manual installation steps and you'll be all set.

### Step 1: Add as a Submodule

Add Mixpanel as a submodule to your local git repo like so:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:mixpanel/mixpanel-swift.git
```

Now the Mixpanel project and its files should be in your project folder! 

### Step 2: Drag Mixpanel to your project

Drag the Mixpanel.xcodeproj inside your sample project under the main sample project file:

### Step 3: Embed the framework

Select your app .xcodeproj file. Under "General", add the Mixpanel framework as an embedded binary:

# Initializing and Usage

<a name="integrate"></a>
## Integrate

Import Mixpanel into AppDelegate.swift, and initialize Mixpanel within `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
![alt text](http://images.mxpnl.com/docs/2016-07-19%2023:27:03.724972-Screen%20Shot%202016-07-18%20at%207.16.51%20PM.png)

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN")
}
```

You initialize your Mixpanel instance with the token provided to you on mixpanel.com.

<a name="start-tracking"></a>
## Start tracking

After installing the library into your iOS app, Mixpanel will <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/which-common-mobile-events-can-mixpanel-collect-on-my-behalf-automatically" target="_blank">automatically collect common mobile events</a>. You can enable/ disable automatic collection through your <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/how-do-i-enable-common-mobile-events-if-i-have-already-implemented-mixpanel" target="_blank">project settings</a>.

To interact with the instance and track additional events, you can either use the mixpanel instance given when initializing:
```swift
mixpanel.track(event: "Tracked Event!")
```
or you can directly fetch the instance and use it from the Mixpanel object:
```swift
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Tracked Event!")
```

You're done! You've successfully integrated the Mixpanel Swift SDK into your app. To stay up to speed on important SDK releases and updates, star or watch our repository on [Github](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift).
